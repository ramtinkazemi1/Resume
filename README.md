## Experience

**Chemistry Lab Assistant** - San Diego Mesa College, San Diego, CA  
August 2018 â€“ March 2020

- Established and maintained a high-quality, mobile 3D station using Oculus technology for students and instructors.
- Facilitated seamless usage of the 3D station by installing necessary apps and tools and providing comprehensive instructions to students and instructors.
- Maintained an accurate and up-to-date inventory record of supplies and equipment to ensure effective monitoring and management.

## Projects

**Maze Solver (Dijkstra)** - Java, Junit, Data structures

- Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue structure (heap) in this project to minimize the cost from the start square to the finish square. Utilized the cost attribute assigned to each square to determine the most efficient path based on the current total cost.

**Transitive Closure Calculation** - JDBC, PostgreSQL

- Developed a Java program using JDBC to compute the transitive closure of a database relation representing fund transfers between accounts. Leveraged SQL commands executed directly on the PostgreSQL server to efficiently manipulate data and minimize data transfers between the Java program and the database. Implemented semi-naive evaluation with logarithmic convergence to perform the computation, storing the results in the influence table at the server.

**File System Management and Filtering** - Java, Data structure

- Developed a comprehensive file system management and filtering system with the goal of efficient organization and retrieval of file information.
- Implemented a custom DefaultMap using a binary search tree, enabling fast key-value pair storage and retrieval operations. Designed the FileSystem class to facilitate seamless management of the entire file system structure, including functionalities such as file addition, date-based file filtering, and wildcard-based file filtering.

**CIFAR-10 Classification with Multi-layer Neural Networks** - Python, Deep Learning Concepts

- Led a team project focused on implementing multi-layer neural networks with softmax outputs to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Developed and optimized code for backpropagation, accurately computing gradients through numerical approximations and ensuring successful weight updates.
- Explored regularization techniques, such as L2 and L1 regularization, to control overfitting and improve network performance. Investigated different activation functions, including sigmoid and ReLU, to assess their impact on training accuracy. Conducted experiments on network topology by adjusting the number of hidden units and layers, analyzing their effects on performance metrics.

**UCSD Mapbox** - JS, React.js, Node.js, MapboxGL, PostgreSQL, Express

- Full Stack Development: Created both frontend and backend of the application, using modern web technologies including React.js for the frontend and Node.js/Express.js for the backend, showcasing versatility as a full-stack developer.
- Interactive Map and Website Development: Developed an intuitive interface integrating Mapbox APIs, enabling users to pinpoint and report issues directly on the map. Key features include a 'Find Me' function for identifying the user's exact location and a form for describing the issue and specifying its urgency level. Additionally, designed and built a hosting website, incorporating smooth scroll navigation, custom styling, and a team section. All these were accomplished after conducting comprehensive research to understand the optimal use of Mapbox APIs and ensuring official project management.
